## Advanced Logic - Line Follower
This session challenges the students to develop a simple line following behavior for their robot. This task is accomplished using the color sensor to detect the present of a line edge and update it's course based on its sensor's feedback. This challenge requires the students to use the programming skills they've required through the previous exercises. A full walk through of the code is below in the Behavior section.

### Behavior
The robot uses the color sensor to check if it sees the color of the line it's following. (The rest of this description will assume that the color of the line is black.) If the sensor sees the color black then.
