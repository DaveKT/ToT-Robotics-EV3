## Distance Test - Math Block Introduction
This program demonstrates the use of math to drive precise robot behavior. In this exercise, the students are required to drive their robot a predetermined distance without using trial and error. In order to make this calculation the students will need to know the circumference of their robots drive wheels and the distance their robot is required to travel. By dividing the distance to travel by the wheel circumference we can get the number of rotations each wheel has to make.

We can represent this formula as,
